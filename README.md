# CustomToDoListExtension

The purpose of this project is for me to learn how to code in javascript as well as learn more about google chrome extensions so that I can make bigger projects.

This project is a custom to do list website/extension things. It is just a basic to-do list with functionality like being able to delete a task, marking a task as completed, as well as a progress bar that shows how close you are done. IT ALSO SAVES DATA ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

I might put this onto the chrome webstore just for funsies but imma have to do some more research before that
